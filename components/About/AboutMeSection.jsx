        Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating beautiful, 
        functional web applications. My journey in tech started 3+ years ago, and I haven't 
        looked back since.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks and have a particular fondness for React 
        and Next.js. Clean code, user experience, and performance optimization are my top priorities.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, sketching ideas , or enjoying a good cup of coffee while reading tech blogs.
